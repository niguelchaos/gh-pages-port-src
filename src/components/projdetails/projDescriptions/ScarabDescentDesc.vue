    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>"Scarab Descent" is a 3D first-person shooter set in a vast desert ruin, heavily inspired by the aesthetics of
      Egyptian mythology with a touch of sci-fi. The game merges FPS mechanics with Metroidvania-style exploration,
      where players must uncover the mysteries of an ancient, insectoid civilization.

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Research</h3>
    <p>
      After establishing the requirements and the general goals of the game, I began by looking at how other
      metroidvanias structured their game world.
      I tried focusing on FPS metroidvanias, but there were not many. In the end, I decided to take a deeper look at
      Metroid Prime: Remastered and Hollow Knight.
      This was because Prime was a clear standard in First Person Metroidvanias, while our game was initially inspired
      by Hollow Knight.
      I examined how the player moved through the world maps from point to point to understand how the maps were built.
    </p>

    <p>
      When looking through the maps, I had the questions below in mind:
    <ul>
      <li> What common elements exist between Prime and HK's maps, despite one being 2D and another being 3D?</li>
      <li> How does the different themes affect the level design in their areas?</li>
      <li> How does the level design assist the feeling of progression, and how does it support different methods of
        traversal?</li>
      <li> How does the level design assist the feeling of ability progression and mastery?</li>
      <li> What techniques are used to maintain engagement when backtracking?</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      I also analyzed the path players took from start to end of Hollow Knight and Metroid Prime.
      More specifically, I traced the path a speedrun took for Hollow Knight, and traced the path the IGN Walkthrough of
      Metroid Prime took to 100% the game.
      Although it is not exactly a fair comparison, I specifically did this to compare the differences between
      speedrunning and a more extensive playthrough to gain insight into both in a limited amount of time.
    </p>
    <p> Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Speedruns clearly have much less backtracking, and the paths which do tend to be in the hub area.</li>
      <li> There are generally smaller hubs which let the player backtrack less before encountering a save
        point/resting area, especially during early game.
        Late game backtracking tends to become longer and longer, not just because of area, but also because gated
        areas are intentionally placed in previous areas.
      </li>
      <li> Players are generally better rewarded for exploring more, which is correlated to more backtracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 2: Initial Design Document</h3>
    <b-col lg="12">
      <p>
        With the general goals set and a general understanding of what kind of metroidvania experience I wanted
        clarified, I created a level design document to organize my thoughts.
        Although I was aware that things could change through iterations, creating the document was surprisingly helpful
        in establishing a "baseline" I could refer back to later on.
        In the document, I establish the the main objectives, the core gameplay, the main pillars, player mechanics,
        pacing and various metrics.

    <h3>Step 3: References</h3>
    <b-row>
      <b-col lg="6">
        <p>Along with the analyses of the paths taken in Metroid Prime and Hollow Knight, I also took other notes regarding gameplay and general level design.
          There was a clear focus on Metroid Prime as it was an 3D FPS Metroidvania, making it closer to what I was aiming for.

    <h3>Step 4: 2D Map</h3>
    <p>
      When creating the 2D map, I kept fundamental considerations from the requirements, observations, genre, and
      narrative in mind:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> There should be at least 2 distinct areas, following the research I did for metroidvanias.
        Distinct areas provide the player with a mental map of where they generally are, creates interesting themes,
        encourages different playstyles,
        and gives a more believable narrative experience depending on the theme.</li>
      <li> Exploration needs to be non-linear. This means that there should be more than 2 paths to reach the final boss
        and different areas.
        The usage of a hub room is a common technique to do this, and thus promote backtracking. </li>
      <li> There should be ability gating to maintain player agency, but still prevent the player from going everywhere.
      </li>
      <li> New abilities should be usable in both exploration and combat.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="my-4"></div> <!-- Spacer with margin -->

    <b-row>
      <b-col lg="6">
        <h5>Draft Layout</h5>
        <p>I began with a draft, settling on a hub-and-spoke topology, with a distinct area for each "spoke".</p>
        <b-img :src="this.draftlayout" fluid alt="Draft"></b-img>
      </b-col>

      <b-col lg="6">
        <h5>Initial Layout</h5>
        <p>I then began populating each area with rooms, reaching the initial layout.</p>
        <b-img :src="this.initiallayout" fluid alt="Initial"></b-img>
      </b-col>
    </b-row>

    <h5>Final Layout</h5>

      After several iterations, I simplified the map to:

    <div class="my-4"></div> <!-- Spacer with margin -->
    <h3>Step 5: Blockout, Iteration and Feedback</h3>
    <h4>Scoping Down</h4>

    <p>After several iterations and feedback, I realized that I had bitten off too much - I was essentially trying to
      create an entire world map. the final layout was smaller, puzzles were removed, and implemented mechanics were
      fewer.
      The general scope was reduced to maintain the self imposed time limit. Instead, I decided to focus and iterate
      more on several rooms.
