              Scarab Descent is a Metroidvania FPS set in a vast desert ruin with a touch
              of sci-fi. The game merges FPS mechanics with Metroidvania-style exploration
              inspired by Metroid Prime and Hollow Knight, where players must find their
              spaceship to leave an alien world.

          </header>

          <p class="strong-content lh-lg">
            Since our game was inspired by Hollow Knight, I decided to study what common
            elements modern metroidvanias have. I chose to examine:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hollow Knight - the original inspiration</li>
            <li>
              Metroid Prime - The "standard" for FPS Metroidvania, which is similar to
              what we set out to make.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Questions I had when researching:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              What common elements exist between Prime and HK's maps, despite one being 2D
              and another being 3D?
            </li>
            <li>How does the different themes affect the level design in their areas?</li>
            <li>How does the level design support the design pillars of each game?</li>
            <li>
              What techniques are used to maintain engagement when backtracking, which we
              know is a common pattern?
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="strong-content lh-lg">I analyzed:</p>
          <ul class="strong-content">
            <li>A Hollow Knight speedrun.</li>
            <li>The path IGN walkthrough of Metroid Prime took to 100% the game.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            I traced the path of both, noting specifically how much backtracking each had,
            placement of enemies, abilities, and how abilities are gated. Although it is
            not exactly a fair comparison, I specifically did this to compare the
            differences between the fastest and "slowest" to gain insight into both in a
            limited amount of time.

                      <li>
                        Speedruns clearly have much less backtracking, and the paths which
                        do tend to be in the hub area.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The topology of both games' world maps is generally hub and spoke,
                        with more sub-hubs the more you go.
                      </li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          There are many reasons for this. Development, world building,
                          player frustration, and exploration are a few.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>
                        Ability gates are often placed in earlier areas, since it gives
                        you a reason to backtrack.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        There are generally smaller hubs which let the player backtrack
                        less before encountering a save point/resting area, especially
                        during early game.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Late game backtracking tends to become longer and longer, not just
                        because of area, but also because gated areas are intentionally
                        placed in previous areas. This is offset by stronger traversal
                        abilities.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Players are generally better rewarded for exploring more, which is
                        correlated to more backtracking. Rewards include resources
                        obtained by killing enemies or finding secret areas.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The final boss is placed near the starter area, likely to give
                        players an objective throughout the game, or for ease of access.
                        Generally locked by a certain skill/item. This item can be
                        retrieved close, and whether you can defeat it is up to skill.
                      </li>
                      <li>Many abilities are optional.</li>
                      <li>
                        Players often need to defeat bosses or challenges to obtain new
                        abilities.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Rooms can be categorized into nodes and edges Edges are often long
                        corridors, Nodes are larger, open space used for large fights or
                        set pieces.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The player can see most of the doors upon entering the room.
                      </li>
                      <li>Large rooms generally expand in verticality too.</li>
                      <li>
                        Organic vs synthetic is also reflected in the layout. Pirate Ship
                        and constructed areas is angular, longer corridors, symmetrical
                        Organic areas like forests have more curves, jagged edges
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Prime uses gate shooting mechanic to hard gate players from
                        entering areas Hollow knight uses soft lock mechanics in some
                        areas, such as the “fog of darkness”
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        From a top down perspective, Metroid Prime is much more linear.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Prime has puzzles that takes advantage of 3D, such as falling
                        bricks, perspective puzzles, and diegetic UI.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Prime doesn’t feature a lot of traditional cover. It is mostly
                        dodging.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Boss areas are arenas of mostly flat spaces, some with gimmicks
                        such as environmental hazards.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Many of the enemies are faster/larger than the player, so its
                        often a waiting game - wait for enemy to attack, and then react.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Hollow Knight is slightly different, but also emphasizes dodging
                        despite parrying being possible.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Distinct areas:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Provide the player with a mental map of where they are</li>

            There was no clear "step" at this stage. The moodboard was iteratively used

            quite messy. <br />
            This influenced specific elements in a room. One clear example was the river
            in the canyon hub, which was inspired by various images of, well, canyons.

            <li>
              There should be a way to prevent prevent the player from going everywhere.
              Ability gating areas is a proven method.

                the entire playable space and mainly influenced the paths the player could

                the rooms are not drawn to scale, as the mechanic metrics at this point
                were not well defined yet. Scale issues would later be a constant battle I

              <p>
                After many iterations of blockout and layout, I greatly reduced the scope,
                and settled on this:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>7 areas reduced to 2.</li>
                <li>Only 2 ability gates exist, following the initial brief's flow.</li>
                <li>Each boss rewards the player with a new ability.</li>
                <li>
                  Each boss has a "theme", shown by the titles underneath each one. I
                  wanted each boss to challenge the player differently.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Since the player could go anywhere at any time, I instead went for a
                  more atomic approach. I wanted a low intensity beat before every boss
                  fight. To show this pacing, I removed enemies in each corridor before
                  each boss.

                Enemy placements, scale (especially the canyon hub), boss areas, and many
                more were affected. However, room placement were roughly the same, and
                many changes aimed to accentuate/support the decisions shown here.

            The blockout was created using UE5's Cubegrid tool. Initially, I created
            entire rooms as a single static mesh asset, only to find it extremely
            difficult to modify later on. I began modelling small, reusable assets that
            turned into a modular kit which I could use to kitbash levels together
            quickly.

            This helped keep scale in check, since I could always measure if an object
            could be jumped over by dragging in something I knew could be jumped over.
            Later, placing world aligned grid textures further helped me gauge scale.

            Kitbashing drastically changed how I approached blocking out rooms. Instead of

            believable spaces by discovering them. <br />Pillars could now be rotated to
            become planks. Removing a boulder created a cave that could hide a secret.
            <br /><br />The Canyon Hub is an example of this, shown below:

          <p class="text-justify">
            Initially, I started this project without planning to implement combat or
            interactive mechanics such as pickups, buttons, weapons, damage systems, or
            enemy AI. As I progressed, there was an increasing amount of elements that
            were difficult to showcase how the level related to specific events and
            combat.
            <br />Some of these were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The turrets on the bridge firing sticky projectiles.</li>
            <li>The rocket being able to destroy destructibles.</li>
            <li>The rocket boss firing at the player from a far distance.</li>
            <li>Combat encounters used to heighten intensity.</li>
            <li>How can I show ability gating without implementing abilities?</li>
            <li>
              How can I show that the player is rewarded after a high intensity area?

          </ul>

          <p class="text-justify">
            Thus began a cycle of prototyping mechanics and AI, playtesting, and iterating
            on the blockout. Combat had a large impact on how levels looked:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enemy AI(and EQS) affected cover, pathing, spacing.</li>
            <li>Weapons (and metrics): rocket explosions radii, fire rate, etc.</li>

          Many things were added, modified, or removed that wasn't considered during
          planning but emerged from playtests. Others happened while I prototyped, blocked
          out, and playtested the game myself. Below is a compiled list of problems and
          solutions across all playtests and feedback at different points in time.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Blocking out 7 areas each with 5+ corridors was too much, and not an MVP.
          </li>
          <li><b>Weapon systems took too long to implement.</b></li>
          <li><b>Puzzles needed additional scripting that took too long.</b></li>
          <li>
            <b>Doors were problematic:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Sliding doors were whole new world of problems. States, animations,
                dynamic sub level loading, players getting crushed, Do enemies follow you
                to the next room? What about obstacles blocking the way?
              </li>
              <li>
                Ability gating in the style of Metroid Prime, where each door only opened
                by being shot by a specific weapon, was removed. Ability gating these
                doors added more bugs.
              </li>

          <li>
            Directly converting Hollow Knight’s map to 3D is not feasible. Adding a new
            dimension naturally morphs the rooms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Each room was too large.</b> It took too long to traverse from room to
            room, even without enemies. I later learned that placing enemies and cover
            made the room feel smaller instead.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Pacing was not representative of the design.</b> Too many rooms between
            major points of interest (Hub room,boss rooms).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Canyon hub is too large.</b> the ruins hub is dwarfed by the sheer contrast
            in size. Additional problem: Moving rooms around was increasingly annoying.

            It was difficult to understand the player's surroundings. Important elements
            to understand were things like entrances, enemy location, events, beginning of
            bossfights.

            "Too much dead time" in between places, where time is just spent walking from
            place to place. Although related to scale, the larger problem was that players
            felt bored in between points of interest.
          </li>
          <li>
            Moving around the blockout was boring - no moving or interactive objects made
            it difficult for players to feel "high intensity".

        </header>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rocket boss was too difficult. It would fire a volley of 8-9 rockets in 1
            second.
          </li>
          <li>
            Players wanted to try out the new abilities they obtained. On my side, I
            wanted to make sure players understood what each ability did right after they
            obtained it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seeing health bars above all enemies overwhelmed the player, giving them a
            sense of "impossible to kill them all".
          </li>
          <li>
            The difficulty contrast between a single enemy in the tutorial, then suddenly
            bombarded by a group of 4 melee + 4 ranged in the Ruins Hub was too much.
          </li>
          <li>
            The rocket ability could fire every 0.1 seconds. Players heavily abused this,
            effectively turning on easy mode for each combat encounter.
          </li>
          <li>
            The bridge was confusing. When entering, many turrets already fire at the
            player, they did not understand the mechanics of the turret.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover was not reliable. When players thought they would be safe, they would
            get hit. <br />This was even worse for the rocket boss, whose rockets had an
            explosion radius.
          </li>
          <li>
            Due to the unique AI for each boss, 3 out of 4 bosses had large changes in the
            level (and in their behaviour) as their behaviour and weapons were added and
            fleshed out. This will be discussed further in the Boss Fights section.

          <!-- scope -->
          <li>
            <b>Reduced distinct areas from 7 to 2</b>, with the minimal amount of
            corridors. Each corridor had a reason to stay, whether it was to ability gate
            something or to balance pacing.
          </li>
          <li><b>No Weapon Alt Fire modes.</b></li>
          <li><b>No weapon reloading.</b></li>
          <li><b>Puzzle to acquire Dash removed, replaced by the Bridge.</b></li>
          <li><b>Removed doors. Instead, placed cover to hide sightlines.</b></li>
          <li>
            <b>No "rest" areas</b> Instead, additional health packs were scattered around
            the map.
          </li>
          <!-- scale -->
          <li>
            Roughly limit how long it takes to get from 1 point of interest to another:
            not more than a minute of walking. Combat encounters were later added to act
            as POIs from a pacing standpoint.
          </li>
          <li>
            Limit verticality. Reaching a different platform should take around 2-3
            jumps/1 min walking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use canyon hub's scale as an opportunity instead to surprise the player and
            encourage exploration.
          </li>
          <li>
            World aligned Prototyping textures: This helped greatly in making sure
            obstacles could be scaled over. It made playtesting more comfortable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Define what 1 "floor" is: Using staircases as measurements to roughly measure
            and standardize how tall things are.
          </li>
          <li>
            Modular kit: Model reusable assets in cubegrid. Example: Use the same doorway
            frame for all entrances. Also helped with scale.
          </li>
          <li>Largely removed corridor to mage boss</li>
          <li>To reduce dead time, added more encounters, especially at corridors.</li>
          <li>
            To reward defeating enemies, added a hidden fireball powerup at one large
            encounter, and more health around others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Made it faster to reach the final boss ability gate. Furthermore, make the
            dash section of the gate much clearer in the beginning. Use destructible
            pillars player can jump over or fire rockets at. Make the dashable gap
            clearer. The player may still take awhile to realize they cannot get to the
            other side, but they would not be able to advance no matter what.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added sound effects for interactions, different sounds when getting hit and
            shooting the ground, and button activations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduced rockets fire rate for rocket boss, made it evade player when on
            cooldown
          </li>
          <li>
            Huge hallways were dead time because they were linear. Used it with more
            intention - to contrast it with larger, open nonlinear areas
          </li>
          <li>
            Some indication of final objective is good - added text in the beginning, and
            a beam of light at the final boss so players can orient themselves at certain
            spots from other rooms, inciting curiousity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tweaked canyon blockout to better show points of interest at different vantage
            points.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bridge: Introducing buttons should be much simpler. Buttons should only open
            doors, not kill turrets as well. Remove all turrets in the button tutorial
            area.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create suspicious pink light in front of bridge's ability gate, make it
            clearer that something exists there.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stepping stones for river in Canyon Hub, make it more inviting/less scary to
            go closer and dip your feet in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Players didn't know what to do after killing rocket boss: Heavy handed
            guidance by preventing the player from leaving unless they pick up the
            ability. Furthermore, shine a spotlight on the ability pickup.
          </li>
          <li>Show instructions only after you get the ability.</li>
          <li>
            Rocket Boss: Show the ability when you trigger the boss fight to tell the
            player where to get the ability, but gate it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dash ability is shown and given at the end of the bridge instead. This softly
            encourages player to use it when returning to the entrance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dash turrets are reactivated only after you obtain the dash ability, letting
            players set the pace.
          </li>
          <li>
            Instead of adding landmarks, give unique properties to each door in ruins hub
            - red/blue light, pillar half way fallen, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bridge has 3 checkpoints when falling into void so you can't cheat the system

          <li>
            Rocket Boss shoots 3 rockets instead of 9, with a cooldown of 3 seconds

        <h3>Backtracking</h3>

        <p>
          Backtracking is focused on the two hubs: The central hub and the canyon hub.
          Following the progression flow in the initial brief, the player would have to
          revisit the central hub at least twice no matter which path they take. One
          future addition I would want to add is to add an ability gate to the central hub
          so that the player has a larger progression reason to revisit it.
        </p>
        <b-img :src="this.backtrackroutes" fluid alt=""></b-img>
        <p class="text-center">Main backtracking routes</p>

        <h3>Ability Gates</h3>
        <p>
          Although the map was created with ability gates in mind, they were not
          implemented early on as it was not high on the priority list.
          <br />
          Initially, it was decided that ability gates would be similar to metroid prime,
          where a door would only open by shooting it with the correct type of gun.
          <br />
          However, doors proved too difficult to implement.
          <br />
          I thus decided to integrate the ability gating into the room itself.
          <br />
          Following the initial brief flow, I created 2 ability gates: The one to The
          Bridge (Dash Ability) and the other one to the Boss.
        </p>
        <b-row>
          <b-col lg="6">
            <h5>Dash Gate: Before</h5>

        </b-row>

        <p>
          This ability gate can be passed with either a double jump OR the rocket. The
          yellow pillar illustrates what happens when the player fires a rocket at the
          gray pillar.
          <br />
          After iterating, I also added an ability check to force the player to dash out
          of the room.
        </p>

        <b-row>
          <b-col lg="6">

          </b-col>
        </b-row>

        <p>
          This ability gate can be passed with either a double jump OR rocket AND the
          dash.
          <br />
          Since this is the final boss, I added much denser debris to hint that something
          important was up ahead.
          <br />
          This setup was very confusing for players. The gap was unclear, and nobody saw
          the double jump platforms.
          <br />After iterating, this was simplified and changed to dash first, since
          players with dash could already complete the game. This also let players quickly
          know if they can enter the area or not. The sky lightbeam hints the importance
          of the room up ahead.

            There are no hitscan weapons in the game. All weapons fire projectiles as
            actual game objects. To simulate miss chance, I instead gave recoil to
            enemies. Miss chance is calculated as recoil over distance. The closer the
            player is, the less recoil the enemy has. However, the recoil caused enemies
            to miss at close distance, which reduces the risk/reward aspect as well as
            "realism" - it didn't feel good. Additionally, Slow projectiles with recoil
            felt like they were more accurate because of player movement (as if the AI was
            leading the shot).

            AI play a flinching when shot, which sets them to a stun state. When
            flinching, enemies cannot fire or move. This gave an extra dimension during
            combat. Melee enemies can block shots, which recover faster than flinching,
            making them advance faster. Furthermore, this gives the player time to take
            cover or continue attacking. I used this mechanic to my advantage as well in
            different bosses, only letting them flinch during specific periods of time
            (during attacking)

            Enemies could only see in front of them. This, in combination of a open world,

            The other piece of the modular puzzle was the damage system component, which

          <p class="strong-content">
            As my first time working on behaviour trees and EQS, making BTs for ~6 enemy
            types was difficult and a headache. Behaviour trees (and EQS) naturally
            drastically changed how the player responded to combat encounters. For
            enemies, I had 2 main goals for normal encounters:
          </p>
          <li>Melee enemies: Encourage the player to move around (kiting), tankier.</li>
          <li>Ranged enemies: Encourage player to take cover, more damage.</li>

          <p class="strong-content">
            Melee enemies chased the player and had a 30% chance to block incoming
            projectiles other than rockets. This gave players an impression of melee
            enemies being tankier without giving them more health. More importantly,
            players with rockets could bypass the "tankiness", providing more risk (close
            range explosions damaging self) and reward.
          </p>
          <p class="strong-content">
            Ranged enemies moved to an ideal location (in range and clear line of fire)
            and fired at the player once, and repeated this. Balancing ranged enemies'
            difficulty was difficult. Feedback conflicted between different player types.
            FPS players found it too easy, while Metroidvania players found it too
            difficult/overwhelming. I experimented with fire rates, damage, and move
            speed. Ranged enemies also find cover and heal if they are low on health.
          </p>
          <p class="strong-content">
            With this, combining melee and ranged enemies in an encounter created a
            balance between cover-taking and movement.

          <p class="strong-content">
            Although its natural that combat should feel and be more intense with more
            enemies, the open world nature created several problems. Players could
            effectively aggro multiple encounters' enemies and take them on a journey.
            Multiple solutions could have been used. I could have broken up the nav mesh,
            set a time limit for enemies to disengage, or set bounds in the encounter. At
            around the same time, I learned and implemented the token system, which
            effectively helped break this dependency of the number of aggro'ed enemies and
            combat intensity. The token system limited the amount of enemies attacking the
            player at any given time.

            I wanted each boss fight to challenge the player a different way. Ideally,
            this would cause boss rooms to be different as well. This philosophy would
            proceed to cause many headaches. Following the initial brief, I already knew
            which ability to give to players early on.
            <br />To this end, I assigned a theme early on to each boss:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Rocket Boss: "The Castle". Emphasize verticality. Boss has the high ground,
              player dodges rockets while reaching the top of the tower.
            </li>
            <li>
              Double Jump Boss: "The Arena". Emphasize stealth, cover taking. Player and
              boss should be in closer proximity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dash Boss: "The Bridge". Emphasize movement and speed. Rather than a single
              boss, reverse tower defense instead.

            A early iterations of the tower. I wanted to integrate some degree of clutter,
            ruins, and route finding. Note that the boss character itself (behaviour,
            animations, etc) has not been created yet at this point. I wanted the boss to
            stay the the top of the tower, firing at the player.
            <br />I also wanted special events to happen, such as the dome falling down on
            the boss to deal massive damage, by shooting at the tethers holding the dome
            up. <br />
            Walking around the space, it is clear the scale is too large, there are many
            blind spots, and its hard to look at the tower itself while going up the ring.

            the player to advance. The scale was still too large; it felt like an ant
            fighting a giant, which was cool, but was not what I was going for.
            <br />
            Having destructible routes was frustrating, since the player had to start from
            the ground and find another route up again. Another issue was the boss could
            fall down from the tower when flinching. Sightlines were another issue. With
            so much clutter (ruins, poles etc), there was no real fear of getting hit by
            rockets because the boss couldn't even see the player half the time.

            consuming. Instead of downsizing the room, I put the arena inside the room
            itself to avoid moving sublevels around.
            <br />The arena's destructibles also softly teach the player what is
            destructible after they obtain the ability. <br />The boss tries to maintain
            maximum distance helped promote player movement around the arena - whether
            they want to get closer to the boss or farther from them. <br />Furthermore,
            the boss tries to take cover when on cooldown. Because of this, the boss does

            In the end, it felt like I strayed away from emphasizing verticality with the

            not feel like I accomplished what I set out to do in this bossfight. However,
            I found this boss reinforced the core combat loop much better than previous
            iterations, from entering the bossfight, obtaining the ability, and
            understanding how to use the ability.

            Showing healthbar made it too easy to find the mage, reducing stealth aspect.

            Hid the healthbar for the mage boss completely. This made it more difficult
            for the player to find the boss, which was good. A more controversial effect
            was the lack of progression feedback. Is the boss nearly dying? How much did
            they heal? In the end, I decided that it was a good tradeoff. The uncertainty
            coupled with the "slippery" feeling of the boss helped emphasize the theme of
            this boss. When the boss goes to heal, it finds a location that is farthest
            away from the player. This forces the player to play hide and seek with it. It
            was a bit too easy for players to find the boss when it was healing due to the
            bright VFX, but I believe the core gameplay is achieved.

            Inspired by The Incredibles scene. Early iterations consisted of little cover
            and was easy to die. However, the difficulty was not the issue. Rather, the
            frustrations came from the feeling of unfairness - there was no way to counter
            the fast moving projectiles. Furthermore, the lack of feedback on damaged made
            it confusing.

            I liked the idea of the projectiles sticking to each other to create emergent
            platforms and cover, similar to a "goo gun" (Prey, The Finals).
            <br />To solve the issue of the player getting trapped, shooting the yellow
            projectiles would loosen them. <br />
            The chaotic nature of the turrets grew on me - to make it less unfair, maybe I
            could add more cover. I planned for the player to press a button at the end of
            the bridge, which would kill all turrets and reveal the dash ability. At this
            point, I had not yet implemented pick ups, buttons, or level events.

            With the button interaction and pickups prototyped, the pacing could be seen

            <br />However, the button at the end of the bridge was confusing. What did it
            do? Where is the dash ability? <br />Playtesters felt extremely confused when
            going through this section of the game. The goal was unclear, the enemy was
            new and has never been introduced, the concept of buttons was new, and the
            player was bombarded by projectiles before they even entered the room.

            Players quickly understood how turrets worked by the time they reached the
            middle of the bridge. Introducing one turret first allowed them to experiment
            what new mechanics there were in a safe space. The first button was confusing,
            as players didnt expect it would kill the turrets. The button at the end of
            the bridge was still confusing - "why did the lights turn off?" "What am I
            supposed to do now?"

            Removed button killing turrets entirely. Dash is given when player reaches the
            end of the bridge. This does 2 things: Returning to the entrance is much
            faster, enhancing the power of the new ability, the theme of speed, and softly
            teaching them the ability. Added a wall to hide behind at the end of the
            bridge for confused players to rest and plan their next move. Added ability
            gate to force them to use the ability to leave the room. Eventually, they will
            have to realize they need to turn back because there is no other way. Turrets
            only reactivate when the player acquires the ability.

          </header>
          <p class="strong-content">
            The goals of this project was to create a "FPS Metroidvania vertical slice
            with a sci-fi desert theme". I believe this game achieved this in terms of
            gameplay design, but the lack of an art pass and unrefined audio hurt
            immersion, the design pillar of exploration, and the idea of a vertical slice.
            I believe I learned a lot from this as well. As my first time doing level and
            combat design on this scale, there were many unforeseen challenges.
          </p>

          <header class="mb-2 pt-3">
            <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3 display-5">The Successful</h2>
          </header>
          <li>
            From a design standpoint I think the metroidvania flow was executed well,
            albeit basic. The playtime and pacing early on (before all the enemies are
            killed) was also good.
          </li>
          <li>
            Boss Fights: One of the most work I put in, each boss fight presented unique
            problems I had never encountered before. Each boss battle challenged the
            player in a different, engaging way.
          </li>
          <li>
            Difficulty: Balancing between FPS players and Metroidvania players was
            difficult. I leaned towards the easier side, but some FPS players still found
            some encounters to be difficult.
          </li>
          <li>
            There were many technical challenges. I had to learn many unreal related
            things to accomplish this. Ranging from AI, Cubegrid, Chaos Destruction,
            animation montages, Level Management, Optimization, and GAS.
          </li>

          <header class="mb-2 pt-3">
            <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3 display-5">The Failures</h2>
          </header>
          <li>
            Pacing was still an issue in the end. The lack of respawning enemies in
            encounters meant more dead time when players had to return to the final boss.
          </li>
          <li>
            The lack of progression systems when defeating enemies is also an issue.
            Health is only for survival, but it doesn't make players stronger or easier to
            defeat enemies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combat in general was also quite barebones. Implementing weak points, for
            example, would have helped engagement. Reloading, animations, different gun
            models would all have been good additions for better combat flow and feedback.
          </li>
          <li>
            Performing and art pass was too difficult. Replacing blockmeshes, adding
            shaders/materials and blending them together was beyond my skill.
          </li>
          <li>
            AI was one of the most problematic challenge. EQS, Behaviour trees, and enemy
            abilities were all interconnected problems that took much time to debug. More
            responsive behaviour and animations for different states and different models
            would also have increased immersion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Destructibles was also underused. I originally wanted every pillar in the
            Arena to be destructible, but debris (the player would spin when standing on
            debris) and performance made it difficult.
          </li>

              What would I do differently if I started this again?
            </h2>
          </header>
          <p>This is actually a disguised learnings section.</p>
          <li>
            I believe genre would be one key thing I would change. The nature of a
            metroidvania made me create a whole world, rather than an "encounter". While
            interesting, this high level thinking initially defined the scope. In the end,
            I still believe 3 bosses, 2 areas, and creating surrounding mechanics from
            scratch is still too large as a piece. It would have perhaps been better to
            only work on a polished room, and 1-2 bosses. The gameplay flow worked well as
            a metroidvania with ability gates, non linear gameplay, and backtracking, but
            it left a lot to be desired in terms of the feeling of exploring an alien
            planet. I think a more linear, Call of Duty style level would have made for a
            better exercise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use off the shelf assets as much as possible! Rather than creating
            interaction, combat, and ui systems myself, I believe it could have looked a
            lot better in the same amount of time if I didnt create everything from
            scratch. One important thing was that I had to rework a lot of levels and
            rooms only when the combat system and AI was nearly finalized. Off the shelf
            combat systems could have let me prototype things earlier. On that note...
          </li>
          <li>
            Make / prototype the combat and AI systems before blocking out the entire
            world! Stupid. It's difficult to imagine a combat space with only combat
            mechanics without enemies, and enemy behaviour can really affect pacing. I
            could have saved a lot of rework time if combat systems were made first.
          </li>
          <li>
            Define and lock down basic player metrics early! Movement speed, jump height,
            dash distance, crouch (i.e. traversal) all caused reworking large parts of
            levels.
          </li>

            <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3 display-5">Future Work</h2>
          </header>

          <p class="strong-content">
            A architecture/art pass would be improve immersion. It would help distinguish
            the two different areas a lot better, and bring it up a level. Polishing the
            UI, weapon feel(recoil, animations) and audio would contribute to more less
            player confusion and greater immersion. Implementing enemy encounter
            respawning would help with pacing.
